# OpenStreetMap Carto - Pedestrian

![screenshot](https://github.com/corb555/openstreetmap-carto-walking/blob/1fe3b736e584b62f742cadb9c64ec72148f3dbe2/seattle_z16.png)

Map stylesheets that emphasize pedestrian and transit exploration of an area.  These map stylesheets can be 
used in Kosmtik/Mapnik to display OpenStreetMaps emphasizing pedestrian rather than car activities.  These are based on 
CartoCSS.

The following are emphasized:
* Walkways and pedestrian areas
* Public rail transit (trains, subways, light rail). 
* Express buses - (not currently shown - needs further investigation)
* Bike network - (work in progress - some are highlighted)
* Landmarks and Natural features - hills, bays, etc.

The following are de-emphasized:
* Road networks (these are rendered in smaller, lighter lines)

These stylesheets should work with [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik)
