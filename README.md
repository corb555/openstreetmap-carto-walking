# OpenStreetMap Carto - Pedestrian

![screenshot](https://github.com/corb555/openstreetmap-carto-walking/blob/1fe3b736e584b62f742cadb9c64ec72148f3dbe2/seattle_z16.png)

These are CartoCSS map stylesheets that emphasize a pedestrian and transit view of 
an area rather than the typical car based view.  These map stylesheets can be 
used in [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik) / Mapnik. The style is based on [openstreetmap-carto][osm-carto].
These stylesheets can be used in your own cartography projects, and are designed to be  customised. 
They work with [Kosmtik][] and also with the command-line [CartoCSS][] processor.
If you want to use the map or tiles in your project, please see the [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) document.

**Style Overview:**  

_The following are emphasized:_  
* Parks, walkways, and pedestrian areas
* Public rail and ferry transit.
* Landmarks and Natural features 
* Express buses - (TO DO.  not currently shown) 
* Separated bike lanes (this seems to work better in the US than Europe)

_The following are de-emphasized:_
* Road networks
