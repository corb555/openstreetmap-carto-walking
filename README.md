These map stylesheets emphasize a pedestrian view using CartoCSS style for OpenStreetMap data. 
The map should tell a story of where it would be fun to explore.

**Style Overview:**

_The following are emphasized:_  
* Parks, walkways, pedestrian areas, pedestrian bridges, stairs  
* Rail and ferry routes 
* Landmarks and attractions  
* Museums  
* Natural features: peaks, passes, rivers, cliffs, capes, harbors, waterfalls, beaches  
* Historic features  
* Restaurants, cafes and bars  
* Sports, hiking, camping
  
_Roads:_  
* Roads are de-emphasized
* Width and font size are used to indicate primary, secondary, residential, etc.

_Buses and biking:_  
* Cycleways and bus routes are not shown since they are complex and there are already dedicated styles  

_Borders:_  
* No administrative borders or names are shown.
