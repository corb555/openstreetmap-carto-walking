# OpenStreetMap Carto - Pedestrian

![screenshot](https://github.com/corb555/openstreetmap-carto-walking/blob/1fe3b736e584b62f742cadb9c64ec72148f3dbe2/seattle_z16.png)

These are CartoCSS map stylesheets that emphasize pedestrian and transit exploration of an area rather than cars.  These map stylesheets can be 
used in [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik) / Mapnik. The style is based on [openstreetmap-carto][osm-carto].
These stylesheets can be used in your own cartography projects, and are designed to be  customised. They work with [Kosmtik][] and also with the command-line [CartoCSS][] processor.
If you want to use the map or tiles in your project, please see the [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) document.

**Style Overview:**  

_The following are emphasized:_  
* Parks, walkways, and pedestrian areas
* Public rail transit (trains, subways, light rail). 
* Express buses - (not currently shown - needs further investigation)
* Bike network - (work in progress - some are highlighted)
* Landmarks and Natural features 

_The following are de-emphasized:_
* Road networks
